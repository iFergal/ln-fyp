# Lightning Network Simulator
Intended to show the benefits of atomic multi-path payments on the Lightning Network and its impact on the success rate of payments.

Can be configured by changing the constants at the beginning of the ln_sim.py - e.g. turning debug mode on to show simulation output.

The call to the simulation is at the end of the file.
